QUESTION: A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real estate
brokers. Last year, ten of the students who completed this course took the exam. The college wants to
know how well its students did on the exam. You've been asked to write a program to summarize the results.
You've been given a list of these 10 students. Next to each name is written a1 if the student passed the
exam or a 2 if the student failed.
Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:
1. Input each test result(i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the message "Enter result" on the screen each time
the program requests another test resul.
2. Count the number of test results of each type
3. Display a summary of the test results, indicating the number of students who passed and the number
who failed.
4. If more than eight students passed the exam, print the message "Bonus to instructor".
