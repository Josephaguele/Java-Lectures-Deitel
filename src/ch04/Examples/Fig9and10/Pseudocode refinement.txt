QUESTION: Develop a class-averaging program that processes grades for an arbitrary number
of students each time it's run

USING STEPWISE REFINEMENT
Determine the class average for the quiz

First refinement: Initialize variables
                    Input, sum and count the quiz grades
                    Calculate and print the class average

Second refinement: Initialize total to zero
                   Initialize counter to zero


                   Prompt the user to enter the first grade
                   Input the first grade(possibly the sentinel)
                   While the user has not yet entered the sentinel
                        Add this grade into the running total
                        Add one to the grade counter
                        Prompt the user to enter the next grade
                        Input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)


                   If the counter is not equal to zero
                        Set the average to the total divided by the counter
                        Print the average
                   else
                        Print "No grades were entered"
