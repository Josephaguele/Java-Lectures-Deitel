QUESTION:
A class of ten students took a quiz. The grades (integers in the range 0 to 100) for this
quiz are available to you. Determine the class average on the quiz.

Note the references in the algorithm of Fig. 4.5 to a total and a counter. A total is a
variable used to accumulate the sum of several values. A counter is a variable used to
countâ€”in this case, the grade counter indicates which of the 10 grades is about to be
entered by the user. Variables used to store totals are normally initialized to zero before
being used in a program.

1 Set total to zero
2 Set grade counter to one
3
4 While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
5 Prompt the user to enter the next grade
6 Input the next grade
7 Add the grade into the total
8 Add one to the grade counter
9
10 Set the class average to the total divided by ten
11 Print the class average
